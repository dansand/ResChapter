#Numpy

## Introduction


Python is a general purpose programming language, designed to be easy to understand. As a generic programming language it has no single role, but it is commonly used for processing text, numbers, images, scientific data, building websites and applications, and visualisation. It enjoys enormous and growing popularity among the (data) scientific research community, as well as professional web adn application developers.

Python was first created by Guido von Rossum in 1990 and was named after Monty Python's Flying Circus. It has since been developed by a large team of volunteers and is freely available from the Python Software Foundation.

That's right, Python is free. More than that, Python has a strong ties to the open source movement. This means there is a culture of sharing, cooperation and support.

Python, Matlab, or R (or Java, C++, ...)? There are a lot of programming languages, and many tasks can be completed equally well in all of them. So how to decide? In our group, some grad students chose Python because it was stronger in discipline-specific Libraries than any of it's competetors (for instance Neuroscience, Geophysics). Some of us had also dabled in other languages first (e.g. Matlab, R), and found that there was litte 'wasted' effort in switching. Many core concepts, extend across all languages, not to mention the more ephemeral skill of 'thinking like a programmer'.


## Learning Objectives:


In this chapter we're going to look a Python tool (Library) called Numpy (numeric Python). A library is a specific set of tools designed to assist a common purpose, yet outside the `core` fucntions of the Langauges. Numpy helps with big (and little) structured groups of numbers (arrays). Depending on the situation, these could represent vectors, time series, tables, grids, matrices, etc.

Using Numpy we're going to attack a simple data science problem, yet one that has some profound implications. Our main suggestion is to __try to understand and keep the data science problem in mind__. Hopefully, if you have a good handle on the problem itself, the utility of Python / Numpy will be self evident. If not, demand your money back.


While you won't finish this chapter a fully-fledged Python programmer, we hope that you will get a sense of the 'flavour' of how Python works. If you haven't programmed before, don't get too worried about understanding _every_ piece of code that's written, but do instead try to focus on how the programming approach to our __data science problem__ differs from a workflow you might develop using a spreadsheet or application (for instance Excel or SPSS).

Necessarily, we will introduce some extraneous concepts and terms, that we don't have time to fully-develop or explore . We will provide links ot material to help you master these subjects later on.


By the end of this chapter you will learn:

1. Why structured, numeric data is cool and totally relevant
2. How to handle, access, and query structured, numeric data, using Python
3. The 'flavour' of using Numpy for a data science problem.

Finally, the introduction should end with a contents page listing how the rest of the chapter will flow.

## A data science example

Our example looks at a real (data) science problem. In fact, we are going to to endeavour to _falsify_ a hypothesis.
We'll try to show that there _are_ predictable patterns in day-to-day stockmarket data, a discovery which would contradict the _efficient market hypothesis_. There are a number of statistical analyses and tests that could help with this problem - (for instance we could look at the the autocorrelation of the sign of the signal derivative). 

Specifically, __we're going to look at whether today's market value _change_ follows yesterday's _change_, at a rate greater than expected if price changes were random__.


_Remember, this is one example out of a plethora of problems that we could have chosen. Don't be lured into thinking that Python is a financial / economics tool. The data analysis here is totally general, and very similar problems will appear in multiple disciplines._

First we're going need to meet Numpy, and learn the basics of  accessing, and querying structured, numeric data.


## Numpy

What do we mean by structured, numeric data? Numpy arrays deal with blocks of numbers, they have dimensions, and shapes.
The shapes are always 'rectangular', meaning the blocks of numbers look like sequences (1-D), rectangles (2-D), or hyperectangles (n-D). In this tutorial we'll deal only with 1d Numpy arrays, which are just a sequence of numbers stretching along their single axis.  Thinks of this as a time series, with n values (elements).

Array Figures here...

We are going to hit the ground running and import some numerical data. In this case, we have a csv (comma separated variable) file containing historical price and volume data from the Nasdaq Stock Exchange (to be precise, the Nasdaq Composite index). This tutorial assumes the data is located in the followinf _relative path_: `../data/nasdaq.csv`.

We assume that you are running this code from the notebooks directory of this book. The easiest (although not necessarily the most robust) way of running the code is to Launch a notebook using the mybinder service. Otherwise we provide instructions at the bottom of this document to assist with installing your own version of Python.

[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org:/repo/dansand/reschapter/archive/master.zip)


#### importing data

```python
numpy.loadtxt('../data/nasdaq.csv')
```

```
array([ 5249.899902,  5227.209961,  5213.220215, ...,   100.760002,
         100.839996,   100.      ])
```

The expression `numpy.loadtxt` is a _function call]_ that asks Python to run the function `loadtxt` that belongs to the `numpy` library.

These values represent the __daily closing price for the Nasdaq composite index__ for a certain number of days.

#### numpy arrays as variables

We can also assign an numpy array to a variable using the same syntax.  Let's re-run `numpy.loadtxt` and save its result:

```python
data = numpy.loadtxt('../data/nasdaq.csv')
```

The following lines will produce a simple plot of the the data

```python
%pylab inline
plt.plot(data)
```

![Alt](../figs/nasdaq.png "Nasdaq data (backwards)")

A couple of introductions to variables can be found here...


#### maths

A great feature of numpy arrays is that we can do maths with entire arrays at once:

```python
data*2
```

```
array([ 10499.799804,  10454.419922,  10426.44043 , ...,    201.520004,
          201.679992,    200.      ])
```

Returns 2  times each element of the original array, as does:

```python
data + data
```

```
array([ 10499.799804,  10454.419922,  10426.44043 , ...,    201.520004,
          201.679992,    200.      ])
```

And a final check:

```python
data - data
```
```
array([ 0.,  0.,  0., ...,  0.,  0.,  0.])
```

#### indexing

If we want to get a single number from the array, we must provide an _index_ in square bracket:

```python
data[0]
```
```
5249.8999020000001
```

```python
print('first value in data:', data[0])
```

```
('first value in data:', 5249.8999020000001)
```
#### slicing

we can select whole sections as well. This is called a _slice_ For example, we can select the first ten days, we could do:

```python
data[0:10]
```
```
array([ 5249.899902,  5227.209961,  5213.220215,  5222.990234,
        5232.330078,  5218.919922,  5212.200195,  5217.689941,
        5260.080078,  5244.600098])
```

So the slice `[0:10]` means start at elemnent / index 0, and go up to (but not including) elemnent / index 10.

The up to (but not including), is simply a decision the engineers made when writing the library, as was the decision to start counting at 0. Feel free to love / hate these conventions.

There are a couple of handy shortcuts with slices. First, if you don't supply one of the indexes, either side of the colon, it defaults, to the start / end of the array. Hence `data[0:10] <=> data[:10]`.

Also, negative indexes visit the elements in reverse order. Given this, which element would we be referring to when we write `data[-1]`? How about using `data[-3]``?

We'll demonstrate now, a trick we'll use later, the combining  of slices and maths (subtraction). Let's say we have an arbitrate array called u then the meaning of the expression u[1:] - u[:-1] is demonstrated in the following figure:


![Alt](../figs/vectorized_diff.png "difference")

The array that results from  u[1:] - u[:-1] is the nth + 1 element of u minus the nth element. Necessarily, output array is one element shorter that u (we loose one element of overlap when we offset)

#### slicing one array with another

Slicing gets a little fancier when we use one numpy array to slice another. Let's create a simple array with some integer values

```python
indices = np.array([1,44,722])
print(indices)
```

```
array([  1,  44, 722])
```

Now the fun begins! Let's try slicing our `data` array with our `indices` array:

```python
data[indices]
```

```
array([ 5227.209961,  4862.569824,  3929.570068])
```

While it might not be immediately obvious, this returned the values of the `data` array, where the elements numbers (indexes) werer provided by the array `indices` (a numpy array we stored in a variable called `indices`)

One way we could check this is by passing both the original and sliced arrays into the Python function `len()` (length):

```python
len(data)
```
```
11496
```

```python
len(data[indicis])
```
```
3
```
So, out original numpy array had 11496 elements, while the sliced array has 3 - like we wanted.


#### asking questions / boolean arrays

Now we go up a gear. Frequently, we are going to want to ask quantitative questions about our data. Consider the following expression, and its output:

```python
data > data.mean()
```

```
array([ True,  True,  True, ..., False, False, False], dtype=bool)
```
We know what `data` is. The new parts here are the `>` symbol and the strange `data.mean()` thingo.  You may guess that `>` is similar to the mathematical _greater than_ operator. Well done. The expression `data.mean()` simply returns the mean of the data array. So `data.mean()` simply stands for a number - the mean of the dataset. To test this, try running `data.mean()` by itself.

```
data.mean()
```
```
1336.6577597914056
```

So what about that output, an array of True and ad False values? In plain English, the code `data > data.mean()`,  could be stated as 'is the value(s) of `data` bigger than the mean value of the data'. Numpy interprets this element-by-element, and returns
* `True` if an an element / value is greater than data.mean()
* `False` if an element / value is smaller. An array of "true" and `False` is called a Boolean array.


The kicker is that we can slice the original array, by this Boolean array:

```python
data[data > data.mean()]
```

```
array([ 5249.899902,  5227.209961,  5213.220215, ...,  1349.050049,
        1340.459961,  1346.359985])
```

Now we can check how many values in our dataset are greater than the mean.

```python
len(data[data > data.mean()])
```


## Challenge

First off, remember that our `data` array contains the daily closing price for the Nasdaq. We are interested in the overall frequency with which today's closing price _change_ follows yesterday's.

We maintain that the following code will return True if todays price `data[1:]` is greater than yesterday's `data[:-1]`. Otherwise it will return False. These True and False values are stored in a new array called `follow`.

```python
follow = data[:-1] < data[1:]
```
Your challenge is to think about what consecutive values like `(...,True, True,...)`, or `(...,False, False,...)` mean?

If this is obvious, then you may want to think about the meaning of the following.

```python
follow[:-1] == follow[1:]
```

Finally, can you hazard a guess at the meaning of:

(follow[:-1] == follow[1:]).sum(dtype=float)

## notes

Numpy vs np

The efficient markets hypothesis (EMH), popularly known as the Random Walk Theory,
is the proposition that current stock prices fully reflect available information about the
value of the firm, and there is no way to earn excess profits, (more than the market over
all), by using this information.

After a bit more Python training, you will understand that in writing `data.mean()` that we have accessed a _Method_ of the object `data`.
